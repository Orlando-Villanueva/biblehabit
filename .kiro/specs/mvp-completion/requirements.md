# MVP Completion - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification focuses on completing the final launch-critical work needed to deploy the Delight Bible reading habit tracker for public release. Based on the comprehensive development roadmap and current 95% completion status, this plan addresses only the absolutely essential remaining features that block public launch.

The core application is fully functional with all user-facing features complete. This MVP completion focuses on production readiness, critical infrastructure, and launch-blocking issues only. Non-essential features have been deferred to post-launch iterations to accelerate time-to-market.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Email Infrastructure Setup (LAUNCH BLOCKING)

**User Story:** As a user who forgets my password, I want to receive password reset emails, so that I can regain access to my account and reading history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL send a properly formatted email with reset link
2. WHEN the email service is configured THEN the system SHALL use Mailgun for production email delivery
3. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL use Mailpit for local email testing and verification
4. WHEN password reset emails are sent THEN the system SHALL use consistent Delight branding
5. WHEN email delivery fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and user feedback
6. WHEN testing email flows THEN the system SHALL verify end-to-end password reset functionality

### Requirement 2: Basic Production Security (LAUNCH CRITICAL)

**User Story:** As a user trusting the application with my personal reading data, I want my information to be secure and the application to meet basic security standards, so that I can use it with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL enforce HTTPS in production
2. WHEN handling user authentication THEN the system SHALL use secure session management
3. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL follow Laravel security best practices
4. WHEN users interact with forms THEN the system SHALL include proper CSRF protection
5. WHEN displaying user content THEN the system SHALL prevent basic XSS vulnerabilities through security headers

### Requirement 3: Essential Error Handling (USER EXPERIENCE CRITICAL)

**User Story:** As a user encountering errors or issues, I want clear feedback and graceful error handling, so that I understand what happened and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with consistent Delight branding
2. WHEN HTMX requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error feedback to users
3. WHEN HTMX requests timeout THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with user notifications
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors for debugging while maintaining user experience

### Requirement 4: Production Deployment Verification (LAUNCH VALIDATION)

**User Story:** As a product owner launching the MVP, I want confidence that core functionality works correctly in production, so that users have a reliable experience from day one.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the email service is deployed THEN the system SHALL successfully send password reset emails in production
2. WHEN users complete core workflows THEN the system SHALL function correctly (registration, login, reading log, dashboard)
3. WHEN accessing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive functionality
4. WHEN performance is measured THEN the system SHALL meet acceptable response times for core features
