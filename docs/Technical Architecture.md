```

**Note:** The `BookProgress` table is a denormalized structure that tracks each user's reading progress for each book of the Bible. There is no direct database relationship (such as a foreign key) between `ReadingLogs` and `BookProgress`. Instead, `BookProgress` is updated whenever a new `ReadingLog` is created or modified. This serves as a performance optimization for statistics calculations, eliminating the need to scan all reading logs when checking book completion status.

**MVP-Focused Data Model**: The initial implementation will focus only on the core entities (Users and ReadingLogs) needed for the MVP's "Read → Log → See Progress" flow. Additional entities like Goals, Achievements, Tags, and ReadingPlans will be implemented in later phases as the application evolves beyond MVP.

# API Structure

This project implements a dual-mode API structure to support both the HTMX-based web interface and future mobile clients. The API is designed to serve HTML fragments for HTMX requests and JSON for mobile/API clients.

## Core User Flow

The MVP focuses on the essential "Read → Log → See Progress" flow with these key user interactions:

1. **User Authentication**: Register, login, and logout functionality
2. **Reading Log**: Create and view reading logs
3. **Progress Visualization**: View streak and reading history calendar
4. **Advanced Statistics**: Track longest streak and Bible books completed

### Web Routes (HTMX-Compatible)

HTMX expects HTML fragments in responses, not JSON objects. These routes are designed for the web interface.

```

## Core Feature Implementation

### Bible Passage Input

The Bible passage input is a critical component of the reading log functionality. For the MVP, we'll implement a simplified two-step structured selector approach to simplify the user experience and ensure data integrity.

#### Structured Bible Passage Selector

The UI will provide a simplified two-step structured selector for the MVP:

1. **Book Selection**:
   - Dropdown menu of all 66 books of the Bible
   - Example: Genesis, Exodus, ... Revelation

2. **Chapter Selection**:
   - Numeric input or dropdown that dynamically updates based on the selected book
   - Constrained to valid chapter numbers for the selected book
   - Example: John has 21 chapters, so the range would be 1-21

**Note:** For the MVP, reading logs will be restricted to whole chapters only to simplify the implementation. Verse-level tracking can be added in future iterations.

#### Implementation Logic

1. **Bible Reference Data**:
   - Maintain a static configuration file with data for all 66 Bible books
   - Implementation as a PHP config file for optimal performance:
   ```php
   // config/bible.php
   return [
       'books' => [
           [
               'id' => 1,
               'name' => 'Genesis',
               'abbreviation' => 'GEN',
               'testament' => 'old',
               'chapter_count' => 50
           ],
           [
               'id' => 2,
               'name' => 'Exodus',
               'abbreviation' => 'EXO',
               'testament' => 'old',
               'chapter_count' => 40
           ],
           // ... remaining 64 books
       ]
   ];
   ```
   - Create a singleton service class to access this data efficiently:
   ```php
   class BibleReferenceService
   {
       protected $books;
       
       public function __construct()
       {
           $this->books = collect(config('bible.books'));
       }
       
       public function getBookById($id)
       {
           return $this->books->firstWhere('id', $id);
       }
       
       public function getBookByName($name)
       {
           return $this->books->firstWhere('name', $name);
       }
   }
   ```
   - This approach is more efficient than a database table since Bible data is fixed and unchanging

2. **Dynamic Selection Logic**:
   - When a book is selected, dynamically populate the chapter dropdown with valid chapter numbers
   - Ensure only valid chapter numbers can be selected based on the chosen book

3. **Reference Formatting**:
   - Format user selections into standardized reference strings in the format "Book Chapter"
   - Example: "John 3" or "Genesis 1"

#### Benefits of Structured Selector Approach

1. **Data Integrity**: Ensures all logged passages are valid Bible references
2. **Simplified UX**: No need for users to remember exact formatting
3. **Reduced Error Rate**: Eliminates typos and invalid references
4. **Consistent Data Format**: Makes analysis and visualization easier
5. **Future-Proof**: Enables potential Bible API integration in later phases

In future iterations, we can add a free-form text input option with validation for users who prefer that input method.

### Responsive Navigation Architecture

The application implements a dual-navigation system optimized for different device types and user patterns:

#### Mobile Navigation Strategy

1. **Bottom Tab Navigation**:
   - **3-tab layout**: Dashboard, History, Profile/Settings
   - **Touch-optimized**: Minimum 44px x 44px touch targets
   - **Fixed positioning**: Always visible for consistent access
   - **Active state indicators**: Visual feedback for current page

2. **Floating Action Button (FAB)**:
   - **Primary action**: "Log Reading" - the most frequent daily action
   - **Strategic positioning**: Bottom-right, above bottom navigation
   - **Accessibility**: Large enough for easy thumb access
   - **Visual prominence**: Uses accent color (#FF9933) for attention

#### Desktop Navigation Strategy

1. **Sidebar Navigation**:
   - **Always visible**: 256px fixed width sidebar
   - **Comprehensive navigation**: All main sections with icons and labels
   - **User context**: Profile section with avatar and quick logout
   - **Active state**: Clear visual indicators for current page

2. **Content Layout**:
   - **Two-column approach**: 70% main content, 30% supporting information
   - **Responsive grid**: Adapts to different screen sizes
   - **Contextual sidebar**: Shows relevant statistics and quick actions

#### Implementation Details

```php
// Layout structure in authenticated.blade.php
// Mobile: Bottom nav (3 tabs) + FAB
// Desktop: Sidebar (always visible) + main content area + secondary sidebar

// Navigation state management with Alpine.js
<div x-data="{ mobileMenuOpen: false }" class="flex h-screen">
    <!-- Desktop Sidebar (hidden on mobile) -->
    <aside class="hidden lg:flex lg:flex-col lg:w-64">
        <!-- Navigation items with active state detection -->
        @if(request()->routeIs('dashboard'))
            <a class="bg-primary/10 text-primary border-r-2 border-primary">
        @endif
    </aside>
    
    <!-- Mobile bottom navigation -->
    <nav class="lg:hidden fixed bottom-0">
        <!-- 3 navigation tabs -->
    </nav>
    
    <!-- Floating Action Button (all screen sizes) -->
    <a href="{{ route('logs.create') }}" 
       class="fixed bottom-20 lg:bottom-6 right-4 lg:right-6">
        <!-- FAB with responsive positioning -->
    </a>
</div>
```

#### Design Rationale

1. **User Journey Optimization**: FAB placement recognizes that "Log Reading" is the primary daily action
2. **Ergonomic Considerations**: Bottom-right FAB position aligns with natural thumb movement on mobile devices
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Desktop layout expands functionality while maintaining mobile-first approach
4. **Accessibility**: Proper touch targets and keyboard navigation support
5. **Visual Hierarchy**: FAB uses accent color to maintain prominence across all pages

#### Route Structure

The navigation system expects these core routes:
- `dashboard` - Main landing page with streak and calendar
- `history` - Reading log history and filtering
- `profile` - User settings and account management  
- `logs.create` - Reading log entry form (FAB target)
- `logout` - Authentication termination

### Advanced Statistics Implementation

The Advanced Statistics feature provides motivating metrics about Bible reading progress. For the MVP, we'll focus on a streamlined set of high-value statistics that encourage habit formation while keeping implementation simple.

#### MVP Reading Statistics Logic

1. **Core Statistics Calculation**:
   - Current streak (using the streak calculation logic with 1-day grace period)
   - All-time longest streak
   - Total chapters read (count of reading logs)
   - Total books started vs. completed
   - Number of days with reading activity
   
   ```php
   // Example controller method for basic statistics
   public function getStatsSummary()
   {
       $user = auth()->user();
       
       $stats = [
           'current_streak' => $this->streakService->getCurrentStreak($user),
           'longest_streak' => $this->streakService->getLongestStreak($user),
           'total_chapters' => ReadingLog::where('user_id', $user->id)->count(),
           'books_started' => BookProgress::where('user_id', $user->id)
                             ->where('completion_percent', '>', 0)
                             ->count(),
           'books_completed' => BookProgress::where('user_id', $user->id)
                               ->where('is_completed', true)
                               ->count(),
           'reading_days' => ReadingLog::where('user_id', $user->id)
                            ->distinct('date_read')
                            ->count(),
       ];
       
       return $stats;
   }
   ```

2. **Post-MVP Statistics** (to be implemented after initial launch):
   - Weekly reading summaries
   - Reading consistency percentage
   - Day-of-week patterns
   - Trend analysis

3. **Book Completion Tracking**:
   - **Performance-Optimized Approach:** 
     - Implement a denormalized `book_progress` table for efficient tracking:
       ```
       ┌────────────────────┐
       │   book_progress    │
       ├────────────────────┤
       │ id (PK)            │
       │ user_id (FK)       │
       │ book_id            │ (from static Bible config)
       │ book_name          │
       │ total_chapters     │
       │ chapters_read      │ (JSON array or serialized data)
       │ completion_percent │
       │ is_completed       │ (boolean)
       │ last_updated       │
       └────────────────────┘
       ```
     - Update this table incrementally with each new reading log:
       - When user logs a chapter (e.g., "Genesis 1"):
         1. Parse the passage to extract book name and chapter
         2. Look up the book_id from the static Bible configuration (e.g., Genesis = 1)
         3. Find or create a BookProgress record for this user and book_id
         4. Add the chapter to the chapters_read array if not already present
         5. Recalculate completion_percentage based on chapters_read vs total_chapters
       - This approach avoids scanning all reading logs for statistics calculations
   - Consider a book "started" when at least one chapter has been read
   - Consider a book "completed" when all chapters have been read at least once

4. **Bible Reading Progress**:
   - Initialize a data structure for all 66 books of the Bible
   - For each book, track:
     - Total chapters in the book
     - Which chapters have been read
     - Completion percentage
   - Update this structure as new readings are logged

#### MVP Visualization Approach

1. **Book Completion Grid**:
   - Simple grid or list showing all 66 Bible books in canonical order
   - Basic color-coding to indicate completion status:
     - Not started: Light gray
     - In progress: Blue
     - Completed: Green
   - Display completion percentage for each book

2. **Statistics Dashboard**:
   - Focus on key motivational metrics:
     - Current streak counter with visual indicator (e.g., flame icon)
     - All-time longest streak
     - Total chapters read
     - Books started vs. completed count
   - Simple, clean design that highlights achievements

3. **Calendar View**:
   - Monthly calendar showing reading activity
   - Color-coded days to indicate reading activity
   - Simple hover/click to see what was read on a specific day

#### Key Statistics Features for MVP

1. **Current Streak Tracking**: Shows the user's current consecutive days of reading (with 1-day grace period)
2. **Longest Streak Tracking**: Records and displays the user's best reading streak ever achieved
3. **Book Completion Tracking**: Shows which books of the Bible have been started and which are fully read
4. **Basic Reading Summary**: Shows total chapters read, books started, and books completed
5. **Calendar Visualization**: Provides a monthly view of reading activity

**Post-MVP Statistics Features** (Phase 2):
1. **Weekly Analysis**: Week-by-week performance metrics and trends
2. **Reading Patterns**: Analysis of reading consistency and preferred days
3. **Advanced Visualizations**: Heat maps and progress charts
4. **Personalized Insights**: Recommendations based on reading patterns

### Streak Calculation Logic

Streak calculation is a critical feature of the MVP. Here's the general approach:

#### Current Streak Calculation

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Retrieve all reading logs for the user
   - Extract and normalize the dates to avoid timezone issues

2. **Streak Logic**:
   - Check if the user has read today or yesterday
   - If neither, current streak is 0
   - If either day has a reading, begin counting consecutive days backwards
   - Count how many consecutive days in the past have readings

3. **Grace Period**:
   - Implement a 1-day grace period
   - Streak continues if user reads either today OR yesterday
   - This makes the habit more sustainable and accounts for timezone edge cases

#### Longest Streak Calculation

1. **Historical Analysis**:
   - Analyze all user reading dates chronologically
   - Find the longest sequence of consecutive calendar days
   - Store this value for display and badges/achievements

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - Account for non-sequential order of data entry
   - Handle timezone shifts
   - Process date gaps appropriately

#### Key Streak Calculation Features

1. **Timezone Handling**: All dates normalized to the start of day to avoid timezone issues
2. **Grace Period**: The streak continues if the user reads today OR yesterday (1-day grace period)
3. **Performance**: Uses efficient date comparison and caching for quick calculations
4. **Historical Data**: Tracks both current streak and all-time longest streak

### Implementation Strategy

The application uses Laravel Sanctum for authentication and implements content negotiation to serve appropriate responses based on the client:

```php
// Web Routes (using Sanctum's cookie auth)
public function index(Request $request)
{
    // Authentication already handled by Sanctum via cookies
    $logs = ReadingLog::where('user_id', auth()->id())->get();
    
    if ($request->header('HX-Request') || !$request->expectsJson()) {
        // HTMX request or regular browser request - return HTML fragment
        return view('partials.logs', ['logs' => $logs]);
    }
    
    // API request - return JSON
    return response()->json($logs);
}

// API token auth for mobile clients
public function login(Request $request)
{
    if (!Auth::attempt($request->only('email', 'password'))) {
        return response()->json(['message' => 'Invalid credentials'], 401);
    }
    
    // Generate Sanctum token for mobile clients
    $token = $request->user()->createToken('mobile-app')->plainTextToken;
    return response()->json([
        'user' => $request->user(),
        'token' => $token
    ]);
}
```

This approach allows the same backend logic to serve both the HTMX-based web interface and mobile clients with appropriate response formats.

# DB_PORT=5432
# DB_DATABASE=laravel
# DB_USERNAME=user
# DB_PASSWORD=password
# DB_SSL_MODE=require
```

### Caching Strategy

As user growth occurs, implementing a robust caching strategy will be essential for maintaining performance and scalability. Here's the planned approach:

#### Cache Layers

1. **Application-Level Cache**:
   - User statistics and streak data (invalidated only on new reading logs)
   - Bible reference metadata (book/chapter/verse counts)
   - User reading history summaries

2. **Database Query Cache**:
   - Frequently executed queries, particularly for statistics calculations
   - Results of complex aggregations

3. **HTTP Cache**:
   - Static assets with appropriate cache headers
   - API responses with ETags and conditional requests

#### Implementation Technologies

1. **Redis**:
   - Primary distributed caching solution
   - Supports complex data structures needed for statistics
   - Enables atomic operations for counters and leaderboards
   - Provides pub/sub capabilities for cache invalidation

2. **Laravel Cache**:
   - Abstraction layer for different cache backends
   - Tag-based cache invalidation for related items
   - Automatic serialization/deserialization of complex objects

#### Cache Invalidation Strategy

1. **Time-Based**:
   - Short TTL (5-15 minutes) for frequently changing data
   - Longer TTL (24+ hours) for relatively static data like Bible reference information

2. **Event-Based**:
   - Invalidate user statistics cache when new reading logs are added
   - Invalidate streak cache at midnight (user's local time) when streaks may change

3. **Selective Invalidation**:
   - Use cache tags to invalidate only affected portions of the cache
   - Maintain cache warmth for high-traffic users and common queries

#### Performance Monitoring

1. **Cache Hit Ratio**:
   - Track and optimize for high cache hit rates (target: >90%)
   - Identify and address cache misses for common operations

2. **Cache Size Monitoring**:
   - Monitor memory usage to prevent cache eviction
   - Implement size-based policies for cache entry limits

This caching strategy will be implemented incrementally as user load increases, with the most performance-critical features receiving caching support first.
