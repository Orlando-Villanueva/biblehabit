**MVP-Focused Data Model**: The initial implementation will focus only on the core entities (Users and ReadingLogs) needed for the MVP's "Read → Log → See Progress" flow. Additional entities like Goals, Achievements, Tags, and ReadingPlans will be implemented in later phases as the application evolves beyond MVP.

# API Structure

This project implements a dual-mode API structure to support both the HTMX-based web interface and future mobile clients. The API is designed to serve HTML fragments for HTMX requests and JSON for mobile/API clients.

## Core User Flow

The MVP focuses on the essential "Read → Log → See Progress" flow with these key user interactions:

1. **User Authentication**: Register, login, and logout functionality
2. **Reading Log**: Create and view reading logs
3. **Progress Visualization**: View streak and reading history calendar
4. **Advanced Statistics**: Track longest streak and Bible books completed

```

## Core Feature Implementation

### Bible Passage Input

The Bible passage input is a critical component of the reading log functionality. For the MVP, we'll implement a structured selector approach to simplify the user experience and ensure data integrity.

#### Structured Bible Passage Selector

The UI will provide a three-step structured selector:

1. **Book Selection**:
   - Dropdown menu containing all 66 books of the Bible
   - Organized in canonical order (Old Testament followed by New Testament)
   - Example: Genesis, Exodus, ... Revelation

2. **Chapter Selection**:
   - Numeric input or dropdown that dynamically updates based on the selected book
   - Constrained to valid chapter numbers for the selected book
   - Example: John has 21 chapters, so the range would be 1-21

3. **Verse Range** (Optional):
   - Start and end verse inputs that dynamically update based on the selected book and chapter
   - Can be left empty to indicate the entire chapter was read
   - Example: John 3 has 36 verses, so the range would be 1-36

#### Implementation Logic

1. **Bible Reference Data**:
   - Maintain a data structure with chapter counts for all 66 Bible books
   - Maintain a data structure with verse counts for each chapter of each book
   - Could be stored as JSON or in the database for easy updates

2. **Dynamic Selection Logic**:
   - When a book is selected, dynamically populate the chapter dropdown with valid chapter numbers
   - When a chapter is selected, dynamically set the maximum values for verse inputs

3. **Reference Formatting**:
   - Format user selections into standardized reference strings:
     - Entire chapter: "John 3"
     - Single verse: "John 3:16"
     - Verse range: "John 3:16-21"

#### Benefits of Structured Selector Approach

1. **Data Integrity**: Ensures all logged passages are valid Bible references
2. **Simplified UX**: No need for users to remember exact formatting
3. **Reduced Error Rate**: Eliminates typos and invalid references
4. **Consistent Data Format**: Makes analysis and visualization easier
5. **Future-Proof**: Enables potential Bible API integration in later phases

In future iterations, we can add a free-form text input option with validation for users who prefer that input method.

### Advanced Statistics Implementation

The Advanced Statistics feature provides motivating metrics about Bible reading progress. Here's the general implementation approach:

#### Reading Statistics Logic

1. **Summary Statistics Calculation**:
   - Retrieve all reading logs for the user
   - Count total number of logs created
   - Determine first and most recent reading dates
   - Calculate longest streak (reusing streak calculation logic)

2. **Weekly Statistics**:
   - Generate week-by-week reading summaries
   - Track number of chapters read per week
   - Calculate weekly reading consistency percentage
   - Identify strongest and weakest reading days
   - Compare current week to previous weeks

3. **Book Completion Tracking**:
   - Parse each reading log to extract book and chapter information
   - Maintain a data structure tracking which chapters have been read in each book
   - Calculate completion percentage based on chapters read versus total chapters
   - Consider a book "started" when at least one chapter has been read
   - Consider a book "completed" when all chapters have been read at least once

4. **Bible Reading Progress**:
   - Initialize a data structure for all 66 books of the Bible
   - For each book, track:
     - Total chapters in the book
     - Which chapters have been read
     - Completion percentage
   - Update this structure as new readings are logged

#### Visualization Approach

1. **Reading Progress Map**:
   - Display all Bible books in canonical order
   - Use color-coding to indicate completion status:
     - Not started: Light gray
     - In progress: Blue gradient based on percentage
     - Completed: Green

2. **Statistics Dashboard**:
   - Display key metrics prominently: total readings, current streak, longest streak
   - Show books started vs. books completed
   - Include a visual progress bar for overall Bible completion

#### Key Statistics Features

1. **Longest Streak Tracking**: Records and displays the user's best reading streak ever achieved
2. **Book Completion Tracking**: Shows which books of the Bible have been started and which are fully read
3. **Reading Progress Visualization**: Provides visual indication of progress through the entire Bible
4. **Summary Statistics**: Shows total number of logs, books started, and books completed
5. **Weekly Analysis**: Provides week-by-week performance metrics and trends

### Streak Calculation Logic

Streak calculation is a critical feature of the MVP. Here's the general approach:

#### Current Streak Calculation

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Retrieve all reading logs for the user
   - Extract and normalize the dates to avoid timezone issues

2. **Streak Logic**:
   - Check if the user has read today or yesterday
   - If neither, current streak is 0
   - If either day has a reading, begin counting consecutive days backwards
   - Count how many consecutive days in the past have readings

3. **Grace Period**:
   - Implement a 1-day grace period
   - Streak continues if user reads either today OR yesterday
   - This makes the habit more sustainable and accounts for timezone edge cases

#### Longest Streak Calculation

1. **Historical Analysis**:
   - Analyze all user reading dates chronologically
   - Find the longest sequence of consecutive calendar days
   - Store this value for display and badges/achievements

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - Account for non-sequential order of data entry
   - Handle timezone shifts
   - Process date gaps appropriately

#### Key Streak Calculation Features

1. **Timezone Handling**: All dates normalized to the start of day to avoid timezone issues
2. **Grace Period**: The streak continues if the user reads today OR yesterday (1-day grace period)
3. **Performance**: Uses efficient date comparison and caching for quick calculations
4. **Historical Data**: Tracks both current streak and all-time longest streak

### Implementation Strategy

The application uses Laravel Sanctum for authentication and implements content negotiation to serve appropriate responses based on the client:

```php
// Web Routes (using Sanctum's cookie auth)
public function index(Request $request)
{
    // Authentication already handled by Sanctum via cookies
    $logs = ReadingLog::where('user_id', auth()->id())->get();
    
    if ($request->header('HX-Request') || !$request->expectsJson()) {
        // HTMX request or regular browser request - return HTML fragment
        return view('partials.logs', ['logs' => $logs]);
    }
    
    // API request - return JSON
    return response()->json($logs);
}

// API token auth for mobile clients
public function login(Request $request)
{
    if (!Auth::attempt($request->only('email', 'password'))) {
        return response()->json(['message' => 'Invalid credentials'], 401);
    }
    
    // Generate Sanctum token for mobile clients
    $token = $request->user()->createToken('mobile-app')->plainTextToken;
    return response()->json([
        'user' => $request->user(),
        'token' => $token
    ]);
}
```

This approach allows the same backend logic to serve both the HTMX-based web interface and mobile clients with appropriate response formats.

## Tech Stack Justification

### Backend: Laravel 12

**Strengths for this project:**
- **Rapid Development**: Laravel's elegant syntax and robust features allow for quick development of core functionality like authentication, database operations, and API endpoints.
- **Eloquent ORM**: Simplifies database interactions, which will be essential for tracking reading logs, streaks, and user progress.
- **Queue System**: Perfect for handling background tasks like sending email reminders without impacting user experience.
- **Authentication System**: Laravel Sanctum for dual-mode authentication, supporting both cookie-based sessions for the HTMX frontend and token-based auth for future mobile APIs.
- **Testing Tools**: Testing frameworks like Pest make it easy to implement a test-driven approach from the start.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Node.js/Express**: While offering good performance for API-heavy applications, it lacks the integrated architecture and mature ORM that Laravel provides.
- **Django (Python)**: Excellent framework but potentially slower development cycle for PHP developers already familiar with Laravel.
- **Ruby on Rails**: Similar benefits to Laravel but smaller community and potentially steeper learning curve.

### Database: PostgreSQL

**Strengths for this project:**
- **Reliability**: Well-established, ACID-compliant database with excellent data integrity.
- **JSON Support**: Native JSON column types ideal for storing flexible data like reading plan structures.
- **Advanced Querying**: Powerful querying capabilities for complex streak calculations and data analytics.
- **Managed Options**: Widely available as a managed service on PaaS providers, reducing operational overhead.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **MySQL**: Slightly simpler but less feature-rich for complex queries and JSON storage.
- **MongoDB**: Would offer flexible schema but less data integrity guarantees for critical user data.
- **SQLite**: Too limited for production use with multiple concurrent users.

### Frontend (Web): HTMX + Alpine.js

**Strengths for this project:**
- **Simplicity**: Both technologies have minimal learning curves compared to full frontend frameworks.
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Allows building interactive features without requiring a complete SPA architecture.
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Main content rendered server-side improves SEO and initial load performance.
- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Lightweight compared to React/Vue/Angular, leading to faster page loads.
- **Reduced Complexity**: No need for a separate build process or complex state management.

**Custom Frontend Approach:**
Rather than using Laravel's official starter kits, this project implements a custom frontend approach with HTMX + Alpine.js, which offers:
- **Server-driven UI updates**: HTMX allows for seamless partial page updates without client-side routing
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Alpine.js provides just enough reactivity for interactive components
- **Progressive enhancement**: Works well even with limited JavaScript support
- **Simpler authentication flow**: Custom authentication system designed specifically for this architecture

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **React**: More powerful but introduces significant complexity and would require a separate build pipeline.
- **Vue.js**: Good balance of power and simplicity but still requires more complex setup than HTMX+Alpine.
- **Inertia.js**: Good Laravel integration but more opinionated and potentially limiting for future mobile API work.

### Mobile: Native Swift (iOS) & Kotlin (Android)

**Strengths for this project:**
- **Performance**: Native development provides the best performance for mobile apps.
- **Platform Integration**: Better access to device features like notifications and offline storage.
- **User Experience**: Follows platform-specific design patterns for more intuitive UX.
- **App Store Optimization**: Better ranking potential in app stores compared to cross-platform solutions.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **React Native**: Would allow code sharing between platforms but with potential performance tradeoffs.
- **Flutter**: Excellent UI consistency but less mature ecosystem and potentially more complex API integration.
- **Progressive Web App**: Simpler to develop but limited device integration and offline capabilities.

### Deployment: PaaS (Render, Railway.app)

**Strengths for this project:**
- **Simplified DevOps**: Reduces operational complexity compared to managing raw infrastructure.
- **Managed Database**: Includes backups, security patches, and scaling with minimal developer intervention.
- **Cost Predictability**: Generally more predictable pricing for early-stage projects compared to raw cloud providers.
- **Quick Setup**: Faster initial deployment and environment configuration.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **AWS/Azure/GCP**: More powerful but requires significantly more DevOps knowledge.
- **VPS Providers**: Lower cost but much higher operational complexity.
- **Shared Hosting**: Too limited for a modern Laravel application with queues and background processing.

## Security Considerations

   - Cookie-based sessions for HTMX web interface
   - Token-based API authentication for mobile clients
   - Built-in CSRF protection for web forms

2. **Data Protection**:
   - All PII (Personally Identifiable Information) will be encrypted at rest.
   - HTTPS enforced for all communications.
   - Rate limiting implemented on all API endpoints to prevent abuse.

3. **Input Validation**:
   - All user inputs validated server-side using Laravel's validation system.
   - Parameterized queries via Eloquent ORM to prevent SQL injection.

4. **API Security**:
   - Token expiration policies.
   - Scope-based permission system for API endpoints.
   - CORS policies properly configured for web and mobile clients.

5. **Database Security**:
   - Least privilege database user permissions.
   - Regular security audits and updates.
   - Automated backups with encryption.

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Database**:
   - Indexed queries for common operations (streak calculations, calendar views).
   - Caching layer for frequently accessed data (current streak, reading plans).
   - Potential sharding strategy for user data as user base grows.

2. **Application**:
   - Stateless API design to support horizontal scaling.
   - Queue workers for background tasks (email sending, achievement calculations).
   - Caching of expensive calculations (streaks, statistics).

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - Ability to scale web servers independently of background workers.
   - CDN integration for static assets.
   - Monitoring and alerting to identify bottlenecks early.

## Future Considerations

This system will be designed to complement rather than overshadow the spiritual nature of Bible reading, with tasteful implementation that enhances the experience without gamifying it excessively.

### Personalized Reminders System

A smart notification system will help users maintain their reading habit through personalized, timely reminders:

#### Reminder Types

1. **Streak Protection Alerts**:
   - Gentle notifications when a user is at risk of breaking their streak
   - Customizable timing (morning, afternoon, evening)
   - Gradually increasing urgency as the day progresses
   - Option to snooze or disable

2. **Weekly Recap Statistics**:
   - End-of-week summary of reading activity
   - Highlights of achievements and progress
   - Comparison to previous weeks
   - Encouraging messages based on performance

3. **Smart Scheduling**:
   - Analysis of user's typical reading times
   - Adaptation to user's timezone and daily patterns
   - Machine learning model to predict optimal reminder times
   - Gradual adjustment based on user response patterns

#### Implementation Approach

1. **Technical Architecture**:
   - Background job system for scheduling reminders
   - User preference storage for notification settings
   - Analytics service to determine optimal timing
   - Multi-channel delivery (push notifications, email, in-app)

2. **Data Requirements**:
   - User reading time patterns
   - Notification response history
   - Preference settings
   - Timezone and locale information

3. **Privacy Considerations**:
   - Clear opt-in/opt-out controls
   - Transparent data usage policies
   - Local processing of pattern data where possible
   - Minimal data collection principle

#### Benefits for Habit Formation

1. **Reduced Friction**: Timely reminders eliminate the need to remember
2. **Streak Protection**: Helps maintain momentum during busy periods
3. **Progress Awareness**: Weekly recaps reinforce the habit's importance
4. **Personalization**: Adapts to individual behavior patterns for maximum effectiveness

The reminder system will be designed to be helpful without becoming intrusive, with careful attention to frequency and tone to avoid notification fatigue.

### Caching Strategy

As user growth occurs, implementing a robust caching strategy will be essential for maintaining performance and scalability. Here's the planned approach:

#### Cache Layers

1. **Application-Level Cache**:
   - User statistics and streak data (invalidated only on new reading logs)
   - Bible reference metadata (book/chapter/verse counts)
   - User reading history summaries

2. **Database Query Cache**:
   - Frequently executed queries, particularly for statistics calculations
   - Results of complex aggregations

3. **HTTP Cache**:
   - Static assets with appropriate cache headers
   - API responses with ETags and conditional requests

#### Implementation Technologies

1. **Redis**:
   - Primary distributed caching solution
   - Supports complex data structures needed for statistics
   - Enables atomic operations for counters and leaderboards
   - Provides pub/sub capabilities for cache invalidation

2. **Laravel Cache**:
   - Abstraction layer for different cache backends
   - Tag-based cache invalidation for related items
   - Automatic serialization/deserialization of complex objects

#### Cache Invalidation Strategy

1. **Time-Based**:
   - Short TTL (5-15 minutes) for frequently changing data
   - Longer TTL (24+ hours) for relatively static data like Bible reference information

2. **Event-Based**:
   - Invalidate user statistics cache when new reading logs are added
   - Invalidate streak cache at midnight (user's local time) when streaks may change

3. **Selective Invalidation**:
   - Use cache tags to invalidate only affected portions of the cache
   - Maintain cache warmth for high-traffic users and common queries

#### Performance Monitoring

1. **Cache Hit Ratio**:
   - Track and optimize for high cache hit rates (target: >90%)
   - Identify and address cache misses for common operations

2. **Cache Size Monitoring**:
   - Monitor memory usage to prevent cache eviction
   - Implement size-based policies for cache entry limits

This caching strategy will be implemented incrementally as user load increases, with the most performance-critical features receiving caching support first.
