# Professional Email Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide covers how to set up professional email sending and receiving for Delight after MVP launch. This is separate from the automated email notifications system and focuses on handling customer inquiries and support emails.

## Current MVP Setup (Simple Approach)
- **Receiving**: Cloudflare email forwarding (`hello@mydelight.app` → personal Gmail)
- **Sending**: Reply from personal Gmail (mention Delight team)
- **Automated emails**: Use existing Mailgun setup for welcome/legal notifications

## Future Professional Email Options

### Option 1: Gmail Send-As with Mailgun SMTP
**Best for**: Small teams, cost-effective solution

**Setup Steps**:
1. In Gmail Settings → Accounts → "Add another email address"
2. Use your real domain email: `hello@mydelight.app`
3. Configure SMTP settings:
   - **SMTP Server**: `smtp.mailgun.org`
   - **Port**: `587`
   - **Username**: Your Mailgun SMTP username
   - **Password**: Your Mailgun SMTP password
4. Gmail will send verification email to `hello@mydelight.app`
5. Ensure Cloudflare forwarding is set up to receive verification
6. Complete verification process

**Benefits**:
- Professional sending address
- Use familiar Gmail interface
- Leverages existing Mailgun setup
- Cost-effective

**Limitations**:
- Still relies on forwarding for receiving
- Gmail interface shows it's sent "on behalf of"

### Option 2: Google Workspace
**Best for**: Growing business, professional appearance

**Setup Steps**:
1. Sign up for Google Workspace ($6/month per user)
2. Verify domain ownership
3. Set up MX records in Cloudflare DNS
4. Create `hello@mydelight.app` mailbox
5. Access through Gmail interface or workspace.google.com

**Benefits**:
- Full professional email hosting
- Native Gmail experience
- Better deliverability
- Professional appearance
- Calendar, Drive, and other Google tools included

**Limitations**:
- Monthly cost
- Need to migrate existing forwarding setup

### Option 3: Alternative Email Providers
**Budget Options**:
- **Zoho Mail**: $1/month per user
- **ProtonMail**: Privacy-focused, $4/month
- **Microsoft 365**: $6/month, includes Office apps

## DNS Configuration Requirements

### For Any Professional Email Setup
You'll need to configure these DNS records in Cloudflare:

**MX Records** (for receiving email):
```
Type: MX
Name: @
Content: [Provider's mail server]
Priority: [Provider specified]
```

**SPF Record** (for sending authentication):
```
Type: TXT
Name: @
Content: v=spf1 include:[provider-spf] ~all
```

**DKIM Record** (for email signing):
```
Type: TXT
Name: [provider-specified]
Content: [provider-specified key]
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Current MVP Setup
- Keep Cloudflare forwarding
- Reply from personal email
- Implement automated notifications

### Phase 2: Professional Sending
- Set up Gmail Send-As with Mailgun
- Start replying from professional address
- Keep forwarding for receiving

### Phase 3: Full Professional Email
- Choose email hosting provider
- Set up proper MX records
- Migrate to professional email hosting
- Update all systems to use new email

## Considerations

### Deliverability
- Professional email hosting has better spam reputation
- Proper DNS configuration improves deliverability
- Consistent sending domain builds trust

### Support Volume
- Low volume: Gmail Send-As is sufficient
- High volume: Professional hosting recommended
- Consider shared inbox solutions for team support

### Integration
- Ensure new email setup doesn't break existing Mailgun notifications
- Test password reset emails after any DNS changes
- Consider using separate domains for transactional vs support emails

## Recommended Timeline
1. **MVP Launch**: Use simple forwarding approach
2. **Month 1-2**: Implement Gmail Send-As if getting regular inquiries
3. **Month 3-6**: Evaluate need for full professional email hosting
4. **Scale**: Move to Google Workspace or similar when team grows
