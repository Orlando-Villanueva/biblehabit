# **Bible Reading Habit Builder - Development Roadmap**

**Core Tech Stack:**

* **Backend:** Laravel  
* **Database:** Serverless PostgreSQL (via Laravel Cloud)  
* **Web Frontend:** HTMX + Alpine.js  
* **Deployment:** Laravel Cloud (PaaS)
* **Development Workflow:** Continuous deployment with feature-based PR structure

## **ðŸ“‹ Roadmap Updates (Post PR-4 Completion)**

**âœ… Authentication Completed:** Successfully implemented user authentication with simplified standard Laravel forms instead of HTMX for reliability and MVP speed (~300 lines of JavaScript complexity removed).

**ðŸ”„ Prioritization Changes:** Reordered PRs 5-10 to prioritize core user functionality over UI polish:
- **Accelerated:** Reading log core features (PR-5) moved up as highest priority  
- **Combined:** UI refinements integrated into later PRs since design system is 85% complete
- **Streamlined:** Reduced from 18 PRs to 10 PRs by combining related functionality
- **Focus Shift:** Emphasis on essential features first, polish and performance later

## **MVP Development Plan**

**Goal:** Launch the core "Read â†’ Log â†’ See Progress" loop to help users establish Bible reading habits.

**Timeline:** 8 Weeks (6 weeks remaining)

### **Development Workflow**

* **Feature-Based PRs:** Each feature developed in a separate branch
* **Continuous Deployment:** Every pushed commit to the main branch triggers automatic deployment to production
* **Hybrid Frontend Approach:** Standard Laravel forms for authentication (simplified), HTMX for dynamic app features (reading logs, dashboard updates)
* **Testing Integration:** 1-2 user testing sessions during development
* **PR Structure:** Clear, focused PRs with descriptive titles and descriptions
* **PR Reviews:** Self-review required before merging
