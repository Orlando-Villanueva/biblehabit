# **Bible Reading Habit Builder - Development Roadmap**

**Core Tech Stack:**

* **Backend:** Laravel  
* **Database:** Serverless PostgreSQL (via Laravel Cloud)  
* **Web Frontend:** HTMX + Alpine.js  
* **Deployment:** Laravel Cloud (PaaS)
* **Development Workflow:** Continuous deployment with feature-based PR structure

## **üìã Roadmap Updates (Post PR-4 Completion)**

**‚úÖ Authentication Completed:** Successfully implemented user authentication with simplified standard Laravel forms instead of HTMX for reliability and MVP speed (~300 lines of JavaScript complexity removed).

**üîÑ Prioritization Changes:** Reordered PRs 5-10 to prioritize core user functionality over UI polish:
- **Accelerated:** Reading log core features (PR-5) moved up as highest priority  
- **Combined:** UI refinements integrated into later PRs since design system is 85% complete
- **Streamlined:** Reduced from 18 PRs to 10 PRs by combining related functionality
- **Focus Shift:** Emphasis on essential features first, polish and performance later

## **MVP Development Plan**

**Goal:** Launch the core "Read ‚Üí Log ‚Üí See Progress" loop to help users establish Bible reading habits.

**Timeline:** 8 Weeks (6 weeks remaining)

### **Development Workflow**

* **Feature-Based PRs:** Each feature developed in a separate branch
* **Continuous Deployment:** Every pushed commit to the main branch triggers automatic deployment to production
* **Hybrid Frontend Approach:** Standard Laravel forms for authentication (simplified), HTMX for dynamic app features (reading logs, dashboard updates)
* **Testing Integration:** 1-2 user testing sessions during development
* **PR Structure:** Clear, focused PRs with descriptive titles and descriptions
* **PR Reviews:** Self-review required before merging

### **Week 7: Performance & Accessibility**

**PR 10: Performance & Accessibility (3-4 days)**
*Priority: Medium - Production readiness*
* Set up caching strategy for user statistics and Bible data
* Optimize database queries and add proper indexing
* Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
* Add HTMX loading indicators and error handling
* Implement performance monitoring and optimization

**üöÄ Detailed Performance Optimization Plan:**

**Critical Performance Bottlenecks (Identified in PR5 Assessment):**
1. **UserStatisticsService::getDashboardStatistics()** - Multiple uncached queries:
   - Current/longest streak calculations load all reading dates into PHP
   - Book progress summary loads all user progress records
   - Recent activity executes separate query
   - Reading summary executes 3 separate queries (count, oldest, latest)

2. **Streak Calculations** - Inefficient PHP processing:
   - `calculateCurrentStreak()` - fetches all dates, processes in PHP memory
   - `calculateLongestStreak()` - fetches all dates, processes in PHP memory
   - Should be converted to SQL window functions for better performance

3. **Calendar Data Generation** - PHP array processing:
   - `getCalendarData()` creates 365 array entries in PHP
   - Could be optimized with database aggregation

**Caching Implementation Strategy:**
```php
// High-impact caching targets
Cache::remember("user_dashboard_stats_{$userId}", 300, fn() => $this->getDashboardStatistics($user));
Cache::remember("user_current_streak_{$userId}", 900, fn() => $this->calculateCurrentStreak($user));
Cache::remember("user_longest_streak_{$userId}", 3600, fn() => $this->calculateLongestStreak($user));
Cache::remember("bible_books_{$locale}", 86400, fn() => $this->listBibleBooks(null, $locale));
Cache::remember("user_calendar_{$userId}_{$year}", 1800, fn() => $this->getCalendarData($user, $year));
```

**SQL Optimization Targets:**
- Convert streak calculations from PHP loops to SQL window functions
- Batch book progress updates during reading log creation
- Add composite indexes for calendar queries: `(user_id, date_read)`
- Optimize book progress aggregation queries

**Cache Invalidation Strategy:**
- Clear user stats cache on new reading log creation
- Clear streak cache on reading log CRUD operations
- Cache user progress indefinitely until book completion changes

**Performance Monitoring Setup:**
- Install Laravel Telescope for query analysis
- Set up database query logging for production
- Monitor cache hit rates and query execution times
- Add performance benchmarks for critical user flows

**[User Testing Session #2]** - Focus on performance, accessibility, and final UX

### **Week 8: Final Polish & Production Deployment**

**PR 11: Final Polish & Production Deployment (2-3 days)**
*Priority: High - Launch readiness*
