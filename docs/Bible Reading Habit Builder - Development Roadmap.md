  9. **Play Store Submission Prep (1 week)**

## **Phase 7: Ongoing Maintenance & Iteration (Both Web & Mobile)**

* **Goal:** Continuously improve the app based on user feedback, fix bugs, update dependencies, and add new features from the "Bible App Ideas" backlog.  
* **Estimated Time:** Ongoing  
* **Tasks:**  
  * User feedback collection and analysis.  
  * Bug fixing and performance monitoring.  
  * Regular dependency updates (Laravel, OS, libraries).  
  * Security audits and updates.  
  * Iterative development of new features (e.g., advanced reading plans, community features, more detailed insights, advanced goal types, etc.).  
  * Marketing and user growth efforts.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Flexibility:** This is a roadmap, not a rigid plan. Be prepared to adapt based on user feedback, technical challenges, and changing priorities.  
* **User Feedback:** Integrate user feedback loops early and often, especially after the Web MVP launch.  
* **Testing:** Don't skimp on testing. Automated tests will save you a lot of time in the long run.  
* **Simplicity:** Especially in early phases, always ask if a feature can be simplified or deferred to keep momentum.  
* **Burnout:** As a solo developer, pace yourself to avoid burnout. Break tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.

This roadmap should give you a solid starting point and a vision for how the project can evolve. Good luck\!
